I have just finished my final exam and I am completely exhausted. But I feel pretty confident about my performance, and I am hoping for a good grade. I think the exam went well, except for a few tricky questions on calculus. The hardest part was definitely the section on derivatives, but I think I managed to get through it.
I'll catch up with you later!
